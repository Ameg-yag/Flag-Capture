## Comment
Very educational and well organized competitions. We have solved all the tasks long before competition has ended. Few tasks were very interesting &ndash; some new ideas about how challenges can look like. In my opinion, the most interesting problems were: *Segal's Law*, which we were solving for three days, and *Enum*.  
I will try to make some write-ups to them just when I'll have more free time.
